🚀 Project Title

DeskFlow AI – Predictive Break Optimization
“Prevent burnout, maintain posture, stay productive”

---
**📖 Project Description**

✨ Problem Statement:
Most productivity apps are reactive—they warn users after posture has deteriorated or fatigue sets in, which often comes too late to prevent strain or burnout.

💡 Proposed Solution:
DeskFlow AI uses real-time AI (PoseNet) and activity tracking to predict the optimal moment to take a break, proactively improving posture and preventing fatigue. It fuses postural degradation and work intensity to make precise predictions, triggering alerts only when both physical and mental strain are high.

---
🎯 Target Users / Use Cases:

- Remote workers and office professionals sitting long hours
- Students studying at computers for extended periods
- Gamers or designers who spend continuous screen time
- Anyone looking to improve posture, reduce fatigue, and maintain productivity
---
🔬 Methodology

1. Research & Ideation – Studied existing productivity/posture apps and identified the reactive gap.
2. Design – Created wireframes, dashboard UI/UX, and system architecture integrating AI and cloud services.
3. Develop – Implemented a single-page web app with:
  - PoseNet for real-time posture tracking
  - Activity event detection (keyboard/mouse)
  - Predictive break logic
  - Firebase authentication
  - Azure Functions for break event logging
4. Test – Conducted unit tests, integration tests, and real-user trials to ensure accuracy.
5. Deploy – Hosted the web app on Azure App Service and enabled real-time logging with Azure Table Storage.

Future Scope –

- Mobile-friendly version
- AI-driven posture coaching suggestions
- Historical analytics of posture and productivity
- Integration with wearables (smartwatches)
